This source code represents portability steps and cleanup that have been undertaken by others and packaged separately from the main development branch to avoid eroding the original source material, mainly because I haven't personally verified these changes.

Ideally the changes in this branch should be verified and merged into the master development branch. 

Feel free to fork and modify this code, but try to contact someone that appears to be responsible or attached to it before you publish new things on your own.

Summary project information and an executable version can probably be found at http://drpetter.se
